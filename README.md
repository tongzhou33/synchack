# Friendli

<h3>The motivation behind this application:</h3>
Friendli is a social media platform that helps users find and join events happening in their area. Users can browse a variety of events, ranging from concerts, sports games, and cultural festivals to smaller meetups and social gatherings. By following their interests and discovering what's happening around them, users can RSVP to events, see who else is attending, and plan their outings. Friendli turns event discovery into a social experience, helping users make the most of their free time and connect with like-minded people.
